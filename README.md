## Project Report

### Reflection
I spend most of this time trying to get a grappling hook to work. Around 8 hours of studying and testing what I might want to go with. I feel like I now have something nuanced and unique that is perfect to iterate upon.
Unfortunately I didn't flesh out much of the rest of the idea. I wanted to add more clear objectives, juice, and level design.
I even set my sights on multiple weapons. Despite this, I enjoy how this project came out and I learned a lot for my final project.
